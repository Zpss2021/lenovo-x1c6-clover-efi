## Installation:
- Create a macOS USB Installer with any method you now.
    - For Sierra and older you need to use the official .dmg from Apple‚Äôs website.
- Mount your USB‚Äôs EFI and paste my CLOVER and BOOT folder from my bootpack
folder to it
    - On Windows you can mount your USB‚Äôs EFI with MiniTool Partition Wizard
        - Open MiniTool, select your USB drive‚Äôs EFI partition, right click, select ‚ÄúChange Letter‚Äù, Click OK, Apply, OK
    - After that you can manage the EFI using Explorer++ in administrator mode
    - On macOS you can use Terminal to mount, or use EFI Mountain Snow.app to mount your USB EFI
    - If there is no EFI folder inside the EFI partition you need to create that first

- After finished, next step is to boot the Installer USB
    - I suggest to boot with config_debug.plist because if anything will go wrong you‚Äôll see the logs of what causing that. 
    - In Clover, select ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù below the partitions, select ‚ÄúConfigs‚Äù, then select ‚Äúconfig_debug.plist‚Äù 
- Install macOS 
    - Don‚Äôt forget to boot from your USB after restarts 
        - If you install Big Sur boot from Preboot only! 
- After installing you need to mount your USB‚Äôs EFI and your System Drive‚Äôs EFI then copy the CLOVER and BOOT folder to your System Drive‚Äôs EFI  
    - (again, if there is no EFI folder, you need to create it first) 
- Unmount and remove your USB Installer and restart your system 

## Post Installation
- Open up your config.plist with Clover Configurator.app, on SMBIOS tab, generate new SMBIOS, then you can log-in to iServices now
- Download <a href="https://github.com/zhen-zen/YogaSMC">YogaSMC.app</a> to manage your fan speed, charging threshold, other SMC related things
